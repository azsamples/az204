Background - Munson\u2019s Pickles and Preserves Farm is an agricultural cooperative corporation based in Washington, US, with farms located across the United States. The company supports agricultural production resources by distributing seeds fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and farm machinery to the farms. Current Environment - The company is migrating all applications from an on-premises datacenter to Microsoft Azure. Applications support distributors, farmers, and internal company staff. Corporate website - \u2022 The company hosts a public website located at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com. The site supports farmers and distributors who request agricultural production resources. Farms - \u2022 The company created a new customer tenant in the Microsoft Entra admin center to support authentication and authorization for applications. Distributors - \u2022 Distributors integrate their applications with data that is accessible by using APIs hosted at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com/api to receive and update resource data. Requirements - The application components must meet the following requirements: Corporate website - \u2022 The site must be migrated to Azure App Service. \u2022 Costs must be minimized when hosting in Azure. \u2022 Applications must automatically scale independent of the compute resources. \u2022 All code changes must be validated by internal staff before release to production. \u2022 File transfer speeds must improve, and webpage-load performance must increase. \u2022 All site settings must be centrally stored, secured without using secrets, and encrypted at rest and in transit. \u2022 A queue-based load leveling pattern must be implemented by using Azure Service Bus queues to support high volumes of website agricultural production resource requests. Farms - \u2022 Farmers must authenticate to applications by using Microsoft Entra ID. Distributors - \u2022 The company must track a custom telemetry value with each API call and monitor performance of all APIs. \u2022 API telemetry values must be charted to evaluate variations and trends for resource data. Internal staff - \u2022 App and API updates must be validated before release to production. \u2022 Staff must be able to select a link to direct them back to the production app when validating an app or API update. \u2022 Staff profile photos and email must be displayed on the website once they authenticate to applications by using their Microsoft Entra ID. Security - \u2022 All web communications must be secured by using TLS/HTTPS. \u2022 Web content must be restricted by country/region to support corporate compliance standards. \u2022 The principle of least privilege must be applied when providing any user rights or process access rights. \u2022 Managed identities for Azure resources must be used to authenticate services that support Microsoft Entra ID authentication. Issues - Corporate website - \u2022 Farmers report HTTP 503 errors at the same time as internal staff report that CPU and memory usage are high. \u2022 Distributors report HTTP 502 errors at the same time as internal staff report that average response times and networking traffic are high. \u2022 Internal staff report webpage load sizes are large and take a long time to load. \u2022 Developers receive authentication errors to Service Bus when they debug locally. Distributors - \u2022 Many API telemetry values are sent in a short period of time. Telemetry traffic, data costs, and storage costs must be reduced while preserving a statistically correct analysis of the data points sent by the APIs.

The company is based in Canada and has retail store locations across the world. The company is developing several cloud-based solutions to support their stores, distributors, suppliers, and delivery services. Current environment - Corporate website - The company provides a public website located at http://www.vanarsdelltd.com. The website consists of a React JavaScript user interface, HTML, CSS, image assets, and several APIs hosted in Azure Functions. Retail Store Locations - The company supports thousands of store locations globally. Store locations send data every hour to an Azure Blob storage account to support inventory, purchasing and delivery services. Each record includes a location identifier and sales transaction information. Requirements - The application components must meet the following requirements: Corporate website - \u2022 Secure the website by using SSL. \u2022 Minimize costs for data storage and hosting. \u2022 Implement native GitHub workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). \u2022 Distribute the website content globally for local use. \u2022 Implement monitoring by using Application Insights and availability web tests including SSL certificate validity and custom header value verification. \u2022 The website must have 99.95 percent uptime. Retail store locations - \u2022 Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries. \u2022 Audit store sale transaction information nightly to validate data, process sales financials, and reconcile inventory. Delivery services - \u2022 Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates. \u2022 Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website. Inventory services - The company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to include read-only access to the data. Security - \u2022 All Azure Functions must centralize management and distribution of configuration data for different environments and geographies, encrypted by using a company-provided RSA-HSM key. \u2022 Authentication and authorization must use Azure AD and services must use managed identities where possible. Issues - Retail Store Locations - \u2022 You must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data. \u2022 Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling.

Current Environment - The company is migrating all applications from an on-premises datacenter to Microsoft Azure. Applications support distributors, farmers, and internal company staff. Corporate website - \u2022 The company hosts a public website located at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com. The site supports farmers and distributors who request agricultural production resources. Farms - \u2022 The company created a new customer tenant in the Microsoft Entra admin center to support authentication and authorization for applications. Distributors - \u2022 Distributors integrate their applications with data that is accessible by using APIs hosted at http://www.munsonspicklesandpreservesfarm.com/api to receive and update resource data. Requirements - The application components must meet the following requirements: Corporate website - \u2022 The site must be migrated to Azure App Service. \u2022 Costs must be minimized when hosting in Azure. \u2022 Applications must automatically scale independent of the compute resources. \u2022 All code changes must be validated by internal staff before release to production. \u2022 File transfer speeds must improve, and webpage-load performance must increase. \u2022 All site settings must be centrally stored, secured without using secrets, and encrypted at rest and in transit. \u2022 A queue-based load leveling pattern must be implemented by using Azure Service Bus queues to support high volumes of website agricultural production resource requests. Farms - \u2022 Farmers must authenticate to applications by using Microsoft Entra ID. Distributors - \u2022 The company must track a custom telemetry value with each API call and monitor performance of all APIs. \u2022 API telemetry values must be charted to evaluate variations and trends for resource data. Internal staff - \u2022 App and API updates must be validated before release to production. \u2022 Staff must be able to select a link to direct them back to the production app when validating an app or API update. \u2022 Staff profile photos and email must be displayed on the website once they authenticate to applications by using their Microsoft Entra ID.

The company is based in Canada and has retail store locations across the world. The company is developing several cloud-based solutions to support their stores, distributors, suppliers, and delivery services. Current environment - Corporate website - The company provides a public website located at http://www.vanarsdelltd.com. The website consists of a React JavaScript user interface, HTML, CSS, image assets, and several APIs hosted in Azure Functions. Retail Store Locations - The company supports thousands of store locations globally. Store locations send data every hour to an Azure Blob storage account to support inventory, purchasing and delivery services. Each record includes a location identifier and sales transaction information. Requirements - The application components must meet the following requirements: Corporate website - \u2022 Secure the website by using SSL. \u2022 Minimize costs for data storage and hosting. \u2022 Implement native GitHub workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). \u2022 Distribute the website content globally for local use. \u2022 Implement monitoring by using Application Insights and availability web tests including SSL certificate validity and custom header value verification. \u2022 The website must have 99.95 percent uptime. Retail store locations - \u2022 Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries. \u2022 Audit store sale transaction information nightly to validate data, process sales financials, and reconcile inventory. Delivery services - \u2022 Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates. \u2022 Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website. Inventory services - The company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to include read-only access to the data. Security - \u2022 All Azure Functions must centralize management and distribution of configuration data for different environments and geographies, encrypted by using a company-provided RSA-HSM key. \u2022 Authentication and authorization must use Azure AD and services must use managed identities where possible. Issues - Retail Store Locations - \u2022 You must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data. \u2022 Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling.
